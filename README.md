# Big-Integer-Datatype
Support of Big-Integer datatype in C/C++

The maximum number of bytes supported by C++ library is of 8bytes under "long long int", which becomes a limiting factor in representing big numbers.
This program converts integers to string , with each digit being stored as a character data type, and supports the basic four arithmetic operations which are implemented in the manner of brute-force, similar to how we do on pen-and-paper.

The program supports operater overloading on the operators of "+","-", "*","/"                                                                                        *

The downside is the memory use-up is too much for representing a single integer.
